# AI-House-Price-Prediction
üè° AI-Powered House Price Prediction and Recommendation System ‚Äì Project Overview

In today‚Äôs dynamic real estate market, making informed property decisions can be challenging. To address this, I developed an AI-based House Price Prediction and Recommendation System that uses machine learning and deep learning to estimate house prices based on key features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities, and more.

This project uses a clean dataset (Housing.csv) and applies preprocessing techniques such as label encoding and feature scaling. A neural network model built with TensorFlow and Keras is trained to predict house prices accurately. To make the insights more practical, the system calculates the price per square foot, assigns ratings, and generates buy/don‚Äôt buy recommendations with simple, human-readable explanations.

An interactive visualization dashboard using Plotly provides users with an intuitive view of property ratings and AI suggestions. This not only makes the results easier to understand but also enhances transparency and decision-making for buyers.

In the future, the system can be expanded with features like image-based analysis, real-time location integration, explainable AI, and deployment as a web or mobile app‚Äîmaking it a powerful tool for modern, data-driven real estate exploration.
